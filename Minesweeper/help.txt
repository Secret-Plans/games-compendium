==========
  BASICS
==========
In
Minesweeper you primary goal is to figure out where the mines are in a minefield without actually
triggering any of them. The way you do can do this is by digging up tiles. All tiles will have a
number that refers to how many mines are around them in the eight surrounding tiles. For example, in
the picture below, there is one mine around the uncovered tile marked '1' and it could be in any of
the spaces marked '?'.

# # # # #
# ? ? ? #
# ? 1 ? #
# ? ? ? #
# # # # #

Using this logic, you can
identify where mines are based off of collections of numbers describing how many of them there are.

Hovering Over: .

This is the game
interface. the block of tiles at the top denotes the game map. In it, covered tiles are represented
as '#', and uncovered tiles are represented as the number of mines surrounding them. Tiles with zero
mines around them are marked '.' and mines are denoted as'*', and ideally you won't have to prove
that yourself. Flags are shown as '|'. The '+' refers to the cursor, or the location you are
currently hovering over. The tile under the cursor can be seen under the map where it says "Hovering
Over:". In this case the cursor is hovering over '.'.
